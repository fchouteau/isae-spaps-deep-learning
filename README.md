# Deep Learning Class for Master SPAPS

This repository contains the code and documentation of a "Deep Learning Introduction" given at ISAE-SUPAERO for the Msc SPAPS

The introduction slides can be accessed at [this URL](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j6TkU6GkT6iZYLy5f0HhrBnJFlIAOR0wzdD4K5tKHgA/edit?usp=sharing). 

Complimenatry slides can be accessed [here](https://fchouteau.github.io/isae-practical-deep-learning/)

It is recommended to read it first as it contains the necessary information to run this from scratch.

There are four notebooks at the root of this repository, those are the exercises

## How to run it ?

This hands on session is based on running code & training using [Google Collaboratory instances](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Check [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ga642381/ML2021-Spring/blob/main/Colab/Google_Colab_Tutorial.ipynb) to learn more about Google Colab

## Reading list

- The Bible : [Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition by Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html), slides & course notes are very useful
- [CS231n: Details on convolutions](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/), how to compute number of parameters & tensor sizes in a CNN...
- [Guide on convolution arithmetics](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic ) and a lot of visualisations to understand convolutions better
- Two [medium blog posts](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53
) that try [to explain things better](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1)

## Usage & Contribution

No support is guaranteed by the authors beyond the hands-on session.

This hands-on session was created by Quentin Léturgie and Florient Chouteau, inspired from a ISAE-SUPAERO class initiated by Matthieu LE GOFF and Florient CHOUTEAU.
